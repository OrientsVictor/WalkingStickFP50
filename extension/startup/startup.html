		<p id="txtContent">This is WalkingStick. I am always by your side to help you navigate the internet. From now on, whenever you open new tab, you will be redirected to the companion web app. There, if you say anything with 'define', you will be provided with a definiton of the word or phrase. Similarly, if you say anything with 'news', you will be provided with a news article and if you say anything with 'play', you can listen to music (or watch videos) from YouTube. Last but not the least, if you press any key when you are in an article or definiton, I can read aloud the texts written there. Happy browsing!
